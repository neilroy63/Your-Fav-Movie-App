## Requirements

The full-stack application will combine a robust back end--with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authenticationâ€”-to an intuitive front end. 

It will continue to build on the agile development methodologies, like storing the project code in GitHub, managing work with a project management tool, and implementing features and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.
